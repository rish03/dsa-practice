ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
dummy.next = head;
ListNode prev = dummy;

prev.next = curr.next;  // affects dummy.next too
➡️ In Java:
dummy and prev refer to the same ListNode object.
So changing prev.next changes dummy.next as well — because both refer to the same object.
Think of them as two names pointing to one object.



class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;

        ListNode curr = head;
        ListNode prev = dummy;
        boolean isDup =false;

        while(curr!=null){
            isDup = false;
            while(curr.next!=null && (curr.val ==curr.next.val)){
                isDup = true;
                curr = curr.next;
            }
            if(isDup){
                prev.next = curr.next;
            }else{
                prev = prev.next;
            }          
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
